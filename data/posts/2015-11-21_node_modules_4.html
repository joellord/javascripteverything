<h2 class="section-heading">Ready for fame?</h2>

<p>Are you finally ready to publish your node module?  Are you ready for fame?  Here is the last and final step to publish your module.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Check if it already exits</h2>

<p>I guess I should've mentioned this in <a href="#/blog/post/2015-11-18_node_modules_1" target="_blank">part 1</a> but before you try to create a new module, make sure that there isn't one that exists already with the same name.  Also check for similar functionalities.  Is it worth it to take the time to publish it if there is already one similar module?  Does your module accomplish something different from the others out there? If you are sure that your baby is unique and worth shring, go ahead and publish!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Publish it</h2>

<p>If you've followed all the steps for far, publishing your module should be a simple matter of entering this command.</p>

<pre>
npm publish
</pre>

<p>Now go to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com" target="_blank">npmjs.com</a> and check for your module.  It should now be there and available for the whole world to npm install ! </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Summary</h2>
<p>That's all folks !  You now have your npm module published.  If you have any questions or comments, feel free to drop me a DM on Twitter or an email. You will find the links at the bottom of this page.</p>
