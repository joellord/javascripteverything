<p>One of the biggest hesitation from Java developers in adopting NodeJs is the fact that it’s single threaded.  So how come so many large companies have still decided to use NodeJs as their backend infrastructure?  Well, the NodeJs is single threaded but it relies on its event loop to delegate work asynchronously.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">So what does that mean?</h2>
<p>I am currently writing this from a small local coffee shop.  This place is a great place to work from.  It’s rather quiet during the weekdays afternoons and they have a great wifi connection.  Because it’s rather quiet, they only have 1 employee during the day.  When I get to the counter, the employee takes my order, goes to the coffee machine to do my coffee and then comes back to the counter with my coffee, tells me the total and I pay using my card.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">So what about this other major coffee chain?</h2>
<p>If you’ve been to this fancy very large coffee shop lately, you might have noticed that things work a bit differently.  Over there, you go to the counter, order your “Triple, Venti, Soy, No Foam Latte”, the clerk asks for your name and yells your order to the other employee that is in charge of the coffee machine.  You then pay and go wait for your coffee a little further away.  Once the coffee is ready, the employee at the counter will call your name and you can pick up your coffee.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Enough about the coffee metaphor</h2>
<p>The local coffee shop acts like a Java server.  You have one process that is triggered every time a request comes in.  This process then does multiple things and ends.  This causes this process to have a lot of idle time.  It is also synchronous.  Everything happens one after the other in an order that you would more or less expect it to happen.</p>

<p>Now, say that the owner wanted to be able to serve more people at once.  He could add another employee with it’s own cash register, coffee machine and credit card machine so that if someone arrives at the same time as I do, both employees will be able to simultaneously serve the two of us.</p>

<p>The larger chain works like a Node server.  The main employee delegates an i/o task to the coffee maker and then continues with his normal tasks which is to make you pay.  Once the coffee is ready, the employee calls your name and you receive your coffee asynchronously (that’s the call back).</p>

<p>Now, if they need to speed up things a little bit during the rush hour, they will add another person at the coffee machine but won’t necessarily add another cashier because the latter is not blocked by the espresso maker.</p>

<p>Node uses this event loop to allow multiple things to happen at once.  This makes it much easier for developers to build scalable systems without worrying about locks.  Despite the fact that Node does not use threads, you can still take advantage of the multiple cores on your server by using child processes (see the <a href="#!blog/post/2016-03-05_using_cluster">blog article</a>).</p>
