<p>There is a lot of very useful methods available to manipulate arrays.  For some reason, I keep forgetting about them and keep reverting back to plain ol' for loops.  I figured that if I wrote something about it, I might remember them form now on.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What's wrong with the for loop</h2>

<p>Nothing! Using those array methods will simply make your code shorter and most likely more readable.  And as I always say, it's much easier to write code than to read it so be nice to your colleagues and use those methods for the sake of readability.</p>

<p>The most common use case for all of these functions would be when dealing with sets of data.  For the next examples, we will be using the following data array.</p>

<pre>
var cars = [
    {
        id: 1,
        make: "Hyundai",
        model: "Accent"
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        make: "Hyundai",
        model: "Elantra"
    }
];
</pre>

<h2 class="section-heading">Array.prototype.filter(<i>callback</i>)</h2>

<p>You can use this method to extract all the matching elements from the array.</p>

<pre>
> cars.filter(function(car) {return car.make == "Hyundai"});
[ { id: 1, make: 'Hyundai', model: 'Accent' },
  { id: 2, make: 'Hyundai', model: 'Elantra' } ]
</pre>

<p>Or even easier/cleaner with ES6 arrow functions</p>

<pre>
> cars.filter((car) => car.make == "Hyundai");
[ { id: 1, make: 'Hyundai', model: 'Accent' },
  { id: 2, make: 'Hyundai', model: 'Elantra' } ]
</pre>

<h2 class="section-heading">Array.prototype.find(<i>callback</i>)</h2>

<p>Find works pretty much the same as the filter function but will only return the first element that it finds.  It's useful when working with unique keys.</p>

<pre>
> cars.find((car) => car.id == 1);
{ id: 1, make: 'Hyundai', model: 'Accent' }
</pre>

<p>But not so useful when working with non unique values.</p>

<pre>
> cars.find((car) => car.make == "Hyundai");
{ id: 1, make: 'Hyundai', model: 'Accent' }
</pre>

<h2 class="section-heading">Array.prototype.map(<i>callback</i>)</h2>

<p>Map will apply a function on each of the array elements and then return the new transformed array.</p>

<pre>
> cars.map((car) => car.transmission = 'automatic');
> cars
[ { id: 1,
    make: 'Hyundai',
    model: 'Accent',
    transmission: 'automatic' },
  { id: 2,
    make: 'Hyundai',
    model: 'Elantra',
    transmission: 'automatic' } ]
</pre>

<p>See?  Much easier and much readable than for loops all over the place.  Those array functions are part of ES5 so they have been available in any major browser for quite a while now.  You should use them.  The arrow functions are a ES6 feature which is <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=arrow-functions" target="_blank">slowly getting adopted by major browsers</a>.</p>
