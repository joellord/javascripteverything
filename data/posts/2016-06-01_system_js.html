<p>I stumbled on SystemJs today.  It seems very interesting to include modules using the ES6 format so I gave it a try and here are some of my findings.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What is SystemJs</h2>
<p>SystemJs is a Universal Module Loader for Javascript.  If you've used RequireJs or a CommonJs bundler in the past, you have probably created modules in the past.  It's essentially a way to break down your code in logical pieces and then include those files only when and if you need them in your actual application.  SystemJs lets you include modules in many different formats but I was mostly interested in the ES6 module syntax.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What's so cool about those ES6 modules?</h2>
<p>Modules are a new feature in ES6.  The syntax is both easy to use and easy to ready.  You can export variables, classes, functions or objects from one file to another using this syntax.  Here is a quick example of how it works.</p>

<p>export.js</p>
<pre>
var accessibleFromOtherFile = 1;
var notAccessibleFromOtherFile = 1;

export var accessibleFromOtherFile;
</pre>

<p>import.js</p>
<pre>
import * as otherFile from “export.js”;
console.log(otherFile.accessibleFromOtherFile); // 1
console.log(otherFile.notAccessibleFromOtherFile); // undefined
</pre>

<p>For more information about ES6 modules, I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html" target="_blank">Dr. Rauschmayer's blog</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Back to SystemJs</h2>
<p>So let's try to use SystemJs to load those modules.  First of all, let's create a very basic HTML page that includes SystemJs.  We'll fill in that empty script tag in a few minutes.</p>

<p>index.html</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Exploring SystemJs&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;


&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://jspm.io/system@0.19.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>Let's also create 2 files.  One for our main application and another one with math functions that we will import into our main application.</p>

<p>main.js</p>
<pre>
import * as math from "./math";

console.log("1 + 1 = " + math.add(1,1));
console.log("1 - 1 = " + math.substract(1,1));
</pre>

<p>math.js</p>
<pre>
export function add(x, y) {
return x+y;
}

export function substract(x, y) {
return x-y;
}
</pre>

<p>Nothing fancy but it makes it easy to start simple.  Now let's edit our index.html page.  We will need to add two lines to configure SystemJs.  The first one will tell SystemJs to use Babel as the ES6 transpiler and the second one will tell it which file is your application entry point.</p>

<p>index.html</p>
<pre>
System.config({
    transpiler: "babel"
});

System.import("./js/app.js");
</pre>

<p>Now run this code in your browser and… tada! the ouput will simply be (in your console).  The use of a separate module was a little bit overkill in this case but you get the point.</p>

<pre>
1 + 1 = 2
1 – 1 = 0
</pre>

<h2 class="section-heading">A note about jspm</h2>
<p>You might have noticed in your network window that the babel-core@5.js file has been fetched automatically from jspm.io.  That is a little bonus of using jspm to load system.js in your script tag.   Jspm is a package manager and can act more or less as a CDN for your files.  More on jspm in a future post.  Suffice to say that it's easy to use with SystemJs.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Anything else?</h2>
<p>Yes, there is another little extra that you get with this.  Now all of your code is transpiled from ES6 to ES5, this means you can use *all* the ES6 syntax in your browser now, so no more reason not to use it.  As an example, you can edit your main.js file to add the following:</p>

<p>main.js</p>
<pre>
//Arrow Functions (this should not work in Safari 9 unless transpiler works)
var arrow = () => console.log("It works! ");
arrow();
</pre>

<p>And you should see “It works!” in your console.  The arrow functions are already part of Chrome but if you try to run this without a transpiler in Safari 9, it would fail.</p>

<p>And that's it! Hopefully, this will help you get started with System Js in your browser and will help you to include more and more ES6 syntax in your code bases.
