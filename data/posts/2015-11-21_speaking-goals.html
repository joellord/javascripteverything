<p>I've just decided that this blog would not only be about technical stuff.  I will add some bits about me from time to time.  Here is one little blog piece about myself. In order for me to progress as a public speaker, I feel that I need to set myself some speaking goals.  Here they are.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Local goals</h2>

<p>For the next year, I would like to talk in at least 2 local conferences. Local is a bit of a strech.  The number of Javascript conferences is limited in the Ottawa region so I will include Montreal and Toronto to the list of locals.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Meetups</h2>

<p>There is a local meetup that has a great community around it.  If you have never heard of Ottawa Javascript, <a href="http://ottawajs.org" target="_blank">look them up</a>.  I will try to have at least 2 talks there (or in another meetup/user group) this year.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">International</h2>

<p>Finally, I'd really want to give a talk in another country.  This would have to be in a city that I have never visited.</p>
